# HCMC historical flood reports — raw source

`hcmc_flood_reports_2002_2026.csv` is a UTF-8 CSV conversion of the public
`Flood_event_locations.tab` table from the dataset below. The conversion
preserves its 22 source columns and 425 observation rows; it does not add
labels, infer dates, generate non-flood examples, or map observations to this
project's road-edge IDs.

`flood_training.csv` is an additional copy exported at the user's requested
filename. Its contents are still these same raw reports; the filename does
**not** mean it is ready for the Flood Colab notebook.

This is a collection of reported flood observations. It is **not** ready for
the Flood Colab training notebook: some source dates are blank, it contains no
verified no-flood observation windows, and it does not contain the project's
`edge_id` labels. Absence of a news report is not evidence that a road was dry.
Do not rename this raw file to `flood_training.csv` or upload it to the training
path without collecting and validating the missing evidence.
